Core SEO setup
Define per‑page metadata using the Next.js Metadata API or generateMetadata, including unique titles, meta descriptions, canonical URLs, and Open Graph/Twitter tags for all routes to improve CTR and social sharing previews.

Use semantic HTML (header, nav, main, section, article, footer) and descriptive headings to help crawlers understand layout and content hierarchy for each page and property detail.

Optimize images: responsive sizes, modern formats (WebP/AVIF), correct width/height, and lazy loading to reduce LCP and improve Core Web Vitals on mobile.

Add canonical tags for language versions and filtered/sorted listing states to avoid duplicate content and consolidate ranking signals.

Generate XML sitemaps (root, properties, blog) and a robots.txt that allows crawling of vital pages while excluding faceted pages with query params.

App Router specifics
Prefer SSG or SSR for content pages and property detail pages to ensure HTML is available to crawlers; avoid client‑only rendering on SEO‑critical pages; use the Metadata API rather than head tags inside components for consistency and no FOUC.

Use Partial Prerendering/hybrid rendering only where needed and ensure metadata is resolved server‑side; keep “use client” components localized to interactive islands (forms, calculators).

International SEO (Arabic‑first)
Separate language URLs: /ar/... and /en/... with mirrored content; set defaultLocale Arabic and ensure server‑side metadata is localized (title/description/OG) for each locale.

Output hreflang tags for each localized page pair (ar‑EG and en‑US/en), plus x‑default to the Arabic root; this prevents duplicate content and sends the right language to users in SERPs.

Localize structured data (name, description, address, priceCurrency EGP) and on‑page copy; ensure RTL markup and Arabic alt text are present for images in Arabic pages.

Real estate schema and rich results
Implement JSON‑LD for:

Organization and WebSite (with SearchAction) on root for sitelinks search box eligibility.

LocalBusiness (or RealEstateAgent/Residence where appropriate) for sales office pages with geo/address/phone/hours.

Product/Offer on unit detail pages with price, priceCurrency EGP, availability, area, numberOfRooms, floorPlan, and image; use BreadcrumbList on all property pages to enhance SERP trails.

For listings index pages, include ItemList with ListItem entries pointing to the canonical detail URLs to help discovery and sitelinks.

Performance and Core Web Vitals
Target <2s LCP on mobile: compress/resize hero images, prioritize above‑the‑fold images, preconnect to CDNs, and defer non‑critical JS; measure with Lighthouse/PSI and fix CLS and INP issues iteratively.

Use Next.js image optimization, route‑based code splitting, dynamic imports for heavy widgets (maps, virtual tours), and avoid blocking third‑party scripts early in the waterfall.

Cache and serve static assets via CDN; prefetch internal links and use link rel=preload for critical fonts to speed first render.

Content and internal linking
Build intent‑matched pages: “Our Projects”, “Project Detail”, “Payment Plans”, “Locations” with area guides; include unique descriptives beyond specs to avoid thin/duplicate content; map keywords to each page in Arabic/English.

Create evergreen content hubs: construction updates, investment tips, neighborhood guides; internally link from these to relevant property pages using descriptive anchors in both languages to distribute PageRank and improve topical authority.

Add FAQ sections with concise Q/A and optional FAQPage JSON‑LD on detail pages to earn rich results and improve long‑tail capture.

URL design and routing
Short, readable, hyphenated slugs in each language, e.g., /ar/projects/اسم‑المشروع and /en/projects/project‑name; keep parameters out of canonical URLs; use rel=“prev/next” or a canonical strategy for paginated listings.

Avoid indexable search results and filtered pages; block via robots.txt or meta robots noindex on faceted states while keeping canonical to the base listing.

Tracking, monitoring, and QA
Install GA4 and Search Console; submit sitemaps per locale; track conversions, scroll depth, and lead submissions; monitor coverage, Core Web Vitals, and hreflang reports in GSC.

Add social tags: Open Graph (og:title/description/locale, image 1200×630) and Twitter Summary Large Image for all shareable pages.

Create custom 404 and 410 handling; return proper status codes; maintain redirect maps for renamed projects to preserve equity.

Developer‑ready snippets
Basic JSON‑LD (Organization + WebSite):

Provide name, url, logo, contactPoint, and potentialAction SearchAction on root to enhance brand presence and sitelinks search.

Hreflang block:

For /ar/contact and /en/contact include alternate links with ar‑EG, en‑US, and x‑default to indicate language targeting to Google.

Property Offer schema:

Use Product with offers: { price, priceCurrency: "EGP", availability, url }, and additionalProperty for area and bedrooms to enrich snippets on unit pages
